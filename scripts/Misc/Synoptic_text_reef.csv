Condition,Good,The good classification shows that all Indicators at or above relevant historical and expected reference levels.,"Cl==""Good"""
Condition,Watch,This classification indicates the habitat condition is moderate but at least one indicator is under performing. It is important to keep this reefs on watch and monitor their trajectories. ,"Cl==""Watch"""
Condition,Warning I,This classification indicates a first level of warning. Reef habitat is either not recovering as expected or certain processes are underperforming. This suggests there is an increased risk of further deterioration. ,"Cl==""Warning I"""
Condition,Warning II,This classification indicates a second level of warning. Reef habitat is are showing signs of a compromised condition. A higher risk of continued degradation is expected unless the performance of recovery processes improve.,"Cl==""Warning II"""
Condition,Critical,This classification suggests reef habitat is in a degraded condition and recovery processes are compromised.,"Cl==""Critical"""

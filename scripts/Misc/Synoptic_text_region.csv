Condition,Watch,This classification indicates the habitat condition is moderate but at least one indicator is under performing. It is important to keep these reefs on watch and monitor their trajectories. ,"Cl==""Watch""",
Condition,Warning I,This classification indicates a first level of warning. Reef habitats are either not recovering as expected or certain processes are underperforming. This suggests there is an increased risk of further deterioration. ,"Cl==""Warning I""",
Condition,Warning II,This classification indicates a second level of warning. Reef habitats are showing signs of a compromised condition. A higher risk of continued degradation is expected unless the performance of recovery processes improve.,"Cl==""Warning II""",
Condition,Critical,"This classification suggests reef habitats are in a critical condition, as they are in a degraded condition and recovery processes are compromised.","Cl==""Critical""",
